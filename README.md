# NextAuth.js session.user undefined in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a bug in a Next.js 15 application using NextAuth.js. After successful authentication, the `session.user` object is unexpectedly undefined within `getServerSideProps` of the About page. 

## Bug Description

The application consists of a Home page and an About page. The About page uses `getServerSideProps` to fetch and check user session data from NextAuth.js. Despite successful login, accessing `session.user` consistently results in a runtime error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user')`.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the Home page, and then click the link to go to the About page.
5. After successful login, observe the error in the console.

## Potential Solutions

Investigating potential solutions is currently underway, and updates will be provided as they become available.  Solutions may involve asynchronous loading, data fetching strategies, or ensuring proper session propagation within NextAuth.js.
